# COMS6998_015_HW1

This repository contains the code submission for COMS E6998 Section 015, Introduction to Deep Learning
and Generative AI based LLM systems. Code files are organized based on the questions. Question 4 and 5
does not require code solutions, therefore do not have their corresponding directories.

The data directory contains the data required for Question 1. Also, in question 3, the FashionMNIST
dataset will also be downloaded into this directory. Please do not remove this directory when testing
the code files.

For question three, PyTorch will use either the embedded GPUs on Apple Silicon chips or CPU to train the
Inception model. If you are using other GPUs, please make sure to change the device setting first before
running the code.
